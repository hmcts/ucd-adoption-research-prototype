                <p class="govuk-body">
                  The court reviews your application and informs the birth parents, if applicable, of your application to adopt.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                  There will be a number of court hearings involving the local authority and social workers. You do not have to attend these. If the birth parents oppose the adoption, they may be present at some of the hearings.
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                  If your application is successful there will be a final adoption ceremony that you and the child are invited to.
                </p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                Once the adoption order is granted, an adoption certificate is created. This replaces the child's birth certificate. It can be ordered from the General Registrar's Office for a small fee.
              </p>

              <p class="govuk-body">If you have applied for help with fees, that application will need to be processed first. The court will let you know whether you have been successful or if you need to pay for some, or all, of your fees.
